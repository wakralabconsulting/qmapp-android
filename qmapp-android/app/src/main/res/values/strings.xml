    <string name="details_page_short_description">Echoes is a prolongation of Al-Muftah’s ongoing research on the recollection of memories and stories that she documents as a continuous autobiography based on personal encounters and family stories.</string>
    <string name="details_page_long_description">The work of Bouthayna Al-Muftah (b. 1987) interrogates stories and practices from Qatari cultural heritage by archiving collective memories and personal encounters using various artistic media including drawing, printmaking and installation.\r\n\r\nEchoe​s is a prolongation of Al-Muftah’s ongoing research on the recollection of memories and stories that she documents as a continuous autobiography based on personal encounters and family stories.\r\n\r\nIn this artistic experiment, she distinctively reflects on the rapid social and cultural changes that have taken place in her surroundings in a short period of time. Al-Muftah utilizes the space to evoke shared local memories and question current local cultural practices visibly influenced by technology with an ever growing focus on individualism. In order to highlight this challenging topic the artist contextualizes the lyrical traditional game ‘tag ‘tag ‘tagya*’ and deconstructs its forms to redefine cultural narratives, offering a symbolic experience in a space in which the past and the present intersect.\r\n\r\nThe artistic process and methodology are prominently prioritized in this space. This is exaggerated by integrating different materials to the project, such as sound, wall mirrors and canvas floor, through which the artist interrogates the perception and the use of traditional collective stories in the context of the contemporary.\r\n\r\n* ‘tag ‘tag ‘tagya is the first phrase of a song used in a traditional group game played by boys and girls from different parts of the Arabian Gulf.\r\n</string>

    <string name="floormap_detail1">This example is a rare example of the Mamluk production of albarelli in Damascus, primarily produced for the European market. The albarello (pl. albarelli) was used as a medicinal jar for holding apothecary ointments and dried herbal drugs. Its elongated shape helps us to recognize the nature and function of this typical object. The Italain word albarello has a quite controversial etymology: sometimes said to be derivng from the Latin albaris, meaning \"in wood\" or \"white\", sometimes from the Arabic al-barmil, which designates a barrel. Albarelli have been produced in the Middle East and Central Asia since the 11th-century and later on in 15th-century Spain and Italy, although they are believed to have been first produced in Syria before making their way to Europe through Spain and Italy. Indeed, many European paintings and archives in France, Italy and Spain refer to vessels produced or imported from Syria.</string>

This particular vase most probably remained in royal or aristocratic families for generations, before being discovered - along with four other similar vases - in a private Italian collection in 2005. Before this re-discovery, only one other albarello of its kind was recorded in the Musee des arts Decoratifs, Paris.</string>
