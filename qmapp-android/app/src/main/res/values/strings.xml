    <string name="floormap_detail1">This example is a rare example of the Mamluk production of albarelli in Damascus, primarily produced for the European market. The albarello (pl. albarelli) was used as a medicinal jar for holding apothecary ointments and dried herbal drugs. Its elongated shape helps us to recognize the nature and function of this typical object. The Italain word albarello has a quite controversial etymology: sometimes said to be derivng from the Latin albaris, meaning \"in wood\" or \"white\", sometimes from the Arabic al-barmil, which designates a barrel. Albarelli have been produced in the Middle East and Central Asia since the 11th-century and later on in 15th-century Spain and Italy, although they are believed to have been first produced in Syria before making their way to Europe through Spain and Italy. Indeed, many European paintings and archives in France, Italy and Spain refer to vessels produced or imported from Syria.</string>

    <string name="floormap_detail2">According to the Medici Archival records in Florence, this vas is possibly one of the three \'alberegli domaschini\' owned by Piero di Cosimo de Medici (1416-59), the de-facto ruler of Florence from 1464-69."
       detailSecondLabel.text = "Like his father before him, Piero continued the family\'s tradition of artistic patronage, extending the collection beyond Italian Renaissance works to include Dutch and Flemish paintings, as well as rare books. This particular vase most probably remained in royal or aristocratic families for generations, before being discovered - along with four other similar vases - in a private Italian collection in 2005. Before this re-discovery, only one other albarello of its kind was recorded in the Musee des arts Decoratifs, Paris.</string>
